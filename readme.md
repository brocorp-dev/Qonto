This package provide you a simple way to sync your [Qonto bank account(s)](https://qonto.eu) and transaction(s) into your database, throught Qonto API and an artisan command. 

## Requirements

This package requires **PHP 7.2**, **Laravel 5.8** or higher and a database already set up in your Laravel project.

## Installation

Install this package via Composer :

``` bash
$ composer require brocorp/qonto
```

Edit your .ENV file and add theses lines :

```
QONTO_LOGIN=your_qonto_login
QONTO_SECRET=your_qonto_secret_key
```

Obviously, we know you're a smart dev, but don't forget to replace `your_qonto_login` and `your_qonto_login` with your own Qonto credentials! 

> Wait! Where to find/generate them? 

Simply check [the "Getting Started" page](https://api-doc.qonto.eu/2.0/welcome/get-started) on Qonto.eu and follow instructions.

Last step, run `php artisan qonto:install` which will perform a migration and running a first full sync into your database.

That's all! 

## Usage, scheduling

Well, you can issue this artisan command to sync your latest 100 transactions for each bank accounts

``` bash
$ php artisan qonto:sync
```

but in most cases youâ€™ll probably want to schedule these commands because it's typicaly boring to type daily this command and it's totally normal, you're not weirdo. This command can be scheduled in `app/Console/Kernel.php` :

``` php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->command('qonto:sync')->daily()->at('12:00');
}
```

Of course, feel free to consult official [Laravel documentation about scheduling](https://laravel.com/docs/master/scheduling#introduction) to adjust it for your own need.
