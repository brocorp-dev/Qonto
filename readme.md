This package provide you a simple way to sync your [Qonto bank account(s)](https://qonto.eu/r/9o3w2g) and transaction(s) into your database, throught Qonto API and an artisan command. 

## Wait, Qonto? 

Yep, [Qonto](https://qonto.eu/r/9o3w2g/) is a neobank, the ideal business account for freelancers, startups and SMEs, in replacement or in addition to your business banking account.

## Requirements

This package requires **PHP 7.2**, **Laravel 5.8** or higher and a database already set up in your Laravel project.


## Installation

Install this package via Composer:

``` bash
$ composer require brocorp/qonto
```

Edit your .ENV file and add theses lines:

```
QONTO_LOGIN=your_qonto_login
QONTO_SECRET=your_qonto_secret_key
```

Obviously, we know you're a smart dev, but don't forget to replace `your_qonto_login` and `your_qonto_login` with your own Qonto credentials! 

> **Wait! Where to find/generate them?** 
> Simply check the ["Getting Started" page](https://api-doc.qonto.eu/2.0/welcome/get-started) on [Qonto API documentation website](https://api-doc.qonto.eu/2.0/welcome) and follow instructions.

You're now ready to install the package with this magical command which run migration and init a first full sync:

``` bash
$ php artisan qonto:install
```

That's all! 


## Usage and scheduling

Well, you can issue this artisan command to sync your latest 100 transactions for each bank accounts

``` bash
$ php artisan qonto:sync
```

but in most cases youâ€™ll probably want to schedule these commands because it's typicaly boring to type daily this command and it's totally normal, you're not weirdo. This command can be scheduled in `app/Console/Kernel.php` :

``` php
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->command('qonto:sync')->daily()->at('12:00');
}
```

Of course, feel free to consult official [Laravel documentation about scheduling](https://laravel.com/docs/master/scheduling#introduction) to adjust it for your own need.


## What's next?

As you can see, this package only fills your database and does not yet provide a blade directive. We are working on it.

However, you can use theses Eloquent models to deal with your freshly synchronized Qonto datas:
- `Brocorp/Qonto/Models/QontoAccount` 
- `Brocorp/Qonto/Models/QontoTransaction`
